  "response": "The digital cosmos is a realm of whispers and echoes. Consider a silent forest at twilight, where individual fireflies, represented by the '1's, glow with a faint, tentative luminescence against the '0' backdrop of the gathering dark. Each '1' is a singular point of light, a potential, a beginning.\n\nWhen the night deepens, these fireflies, through some unseen communion, begin to amplify their own light. It's as if each glowing ember, having found a neighbor \u2013 an adjacent '1' \u2013 feels emboldened, its light intensifying to a brilliant '2'. This '2' isn't just a brighter '1'; it's a shared resonance, a symbiotic flourishing. A single firefly, finding itself alone in the dark ('010'), might dim or fade, but when two are in proximity, or even when one encounters another on the edges of its perception ('110' becoming '220'), their mutual illumination solidifies. They become beacon-like, drawing more attention, a bolder declaration of existence.\n\nThis transformation isn't just a random flicker. It's akin to how ideas spread in a social network, how epidemics bloom, or how chemical reactions accelerate in the presence of a catalyst. The '1's are the initial sparks, and the '2's are the ignited conversations, the burgeoning communities, the cascading chain reactions. The output grid, with its doubled intensity, shows this amplification. Rows that were once simply lined with transient glows ('010', '101') now pulse with a doubled luminescence ('020', '202'). Even solitary glowing points in the input gain a mirrored intensity if they border a space where a '1' existed or could have existed, as if the possibility of light itself casts a faint shadow of future brilliance. The output, with its doubled rows and the way the pattern is subtly extended, represents the persistent glow of awakened awareness, where once-faint signals now echo and amplify across the entire digital landscape."
