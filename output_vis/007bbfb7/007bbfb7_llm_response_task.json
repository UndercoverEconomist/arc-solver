Imagine a cosmic craftsman, a weaver of realities, who takes small, intricate patterns\u2014like constellations etched onto a velvet night sky\u2014and, with a gentle yet decisive hand, expands them. This craftsman doesn't merely copy; they imbue the pattern with its own echo, its own reflection, scattering it across a larger canvas.\n\nConsider the initial patterns as tiny seeds, each a unique cipher of existence, be it the sharp, angular \u20187\u2019s clustered in a celestial glyph, the balanced \u20184\u2019s flanking an emptiness, the nascent life of \u20182\u2019 amidst dormant \u20180\u2019s, or the bold \u20186\u2019s marking boundaries. When the cosmic breath blows, these seeds don't just sprout; they *replicate their essence* and disperse.\n\nThe transformation is akin to the expansion of a star system. The original pattern, like a solar core, retains its integrity, but its energy\u2014represented by the non-zero digits\u2014propagates outwards. This outward diffusion isn't a uniform spread; it's more like gravitational waves, each non-zero digit sending ripples through the emptiness, attracting and re-forming itself at specific distances. The \u20180\u2019s act as the cosmic void, the vacuum where these waves travel and dissipate, only to reform the original pattern at a calculated distance.\n\nThink of it like a cultural diaspora. A core belief system (the non-zero digits) is preserved, but its tenets are carried across vast distances. As these ideas travel, they create new settlements, mirroring the original structure, but interspersed with new territories of understanding (the expanded zeros). These settlements are not identical copies; they are echoes, preserving the fundamental structure while adapting to the larger expanse.\n\nFor example, the block of '7's, forming a cross-like shape, doesn't just duplicate. Its central bar and upper/lower arms appear at scaled intervals. The middle row of '7's from the input, being the longest radiant line, becomes a major filament in the larger output, pushing its \u20187\u2019s further and influencing rows both above and below. The zeros are not just passive space; they are the silent conductors, ensuring the spatial separation and thematic echo of the original pattern.\n\nThe process is like a geological event: a seismic shock (the presence of non-zero digits) creates waves that travel through the earth (the grid). These waves don't just fade; they re-form the initial geological strata (the original pattern) at multiple points, creating symmetrical structures that hint at the primal event. Each '0' is the pliable rock, yielding to the imprint of the original message, ensuring the narrative of the non-zero digits is repeated, reshaped, and amplified across the grander fabric of the canvas. The output matrix is a larger tapestry woven from these resonant echoes, a cosmic symphony played on the strings of numerical presence and absence.\n```"
