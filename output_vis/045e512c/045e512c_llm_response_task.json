The initial states are like dormant seeds in barren earth \u2013 full of potential but quiescent. When a number appears, it's a spark of intent, a seed awakening.\n\nIn the first example, a cluster of `8`s and a lone `3` form a nascent constellation against the black velvet of space. The transformation is akin to an echo in a canyon. The `8`s, like a powerful voice, reverberate outwards, their sound waves (`3`s, representing energy dispersal) fanning out, filling the surrounding void. The `3` itself doesn't disappear but becomes a source of this expanding resonance, spreading its essence as if it were light refracting through a prism. The scattered `2`s at the bottom, like distant stars, also receive a faint, parallel echo, a ghost of the primary eruption.\n\nThe second example presents a solitary `4` and a rudimentary cross of `1`s, framed by `2`s on the periphery. The `4` is a celestial body, a sun, from which light (`4`s) begins to radiate, pushing back the darkness. Simultaneously, a constellation of `2`s, like distant galaxies, start to orbit, their presence influencing the gravitational field and causing the `4`'s light to bend and stretch. The cross of `1`s, an artifact of creation, stands as a stable beacon at the center of this unfolding cosmic dance. The transformation shows the gravitational pull of the central cross (`1`s) and the emanating light of the `4`, acting like dark matter and observable light, creating complex patterns. The `2`s on the edges, like observers at the edge of the known universe, witness this intricate choreography, their own influence subtly reshaping the outermost boundaries.\n\nThe third example depicts `6`s scattered in a vertical formation, with a `5`-shaped silhouette and a `1` nucleus. This resembles the formation of a new solar system or a biological cell dividing. The `6`s, like primordial gases, coalesce. The `5`-shaped figure, a more complex form, acts as a gravitational well, drawing these gases and, more importantly, influencing the structure of the `1`. The transformation is like watching a star ignite and its gravitational field start to organize surrounding nebulae. The `1` nucleus, the heart of this developing structure, begins to divide, sending out tendrils of influence (`1`s) that mimic the parent `5`'s structure, suggesting cellular division or crystallization. The `6`s, acting as a diffuse medium, become the raw material for these new formations, their scattering and clustering reflecting the energy and pressure dynamics of an astrophysical or biological process. The process is like a geological event, where existing strata are shifted and new layers form, their density and shape dictated by underlying pressures and elemental composition.\n```"
